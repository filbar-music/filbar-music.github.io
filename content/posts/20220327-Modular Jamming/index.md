When I started venturing from software to hardware synthesizers I didn't know what I was doing, nor did I know what I wanted to do with them.  I just wanted something more tactile to play and learn with.  ... and it had to be analog, for soem reason I had at the time.  So I started building DIY kits and learning.  Originally I treated it like an instrument.  I could record parts of a song into a DAW and go from there.  But the more that I played with it, the more I just wanted to play with it, to get a solid groove going and just ride it.

Turns out that isn't quite so easy to do when you have a small handful of exclusively analog modules ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. So I expanded and refined my viewpoint, and fully embraced the wonderland that is combining analog and digital modules all in one rig.  

This here is a raw unprocessed snippet of some fun I was having the other evening playing with Basilimus Iteritas Alter, Mimetic Digitalis, Music Thing Radio Music and Mutable's fabulous Beads.
